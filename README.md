# diesel-rust-learning
Holds the interesting mini projects I have completed while learning rocket and diesel. (omitts many less fruitful tangent projects I went on)

The Diesel folder contains diesel-demo, the code for a database which was a step by step follow of the diesel guide, and diesel-events which contains the code for a database with different variables and versions of CRUD operations

The Rust folder contains a basic rocket program, a static rust webpage (rocket-web) a more recent tangent I went on following a guide to figure out how to integrate my database with a website that I ended up abandoning (events) and events_restart where I was able to successfully display data from my database to a webpage.
