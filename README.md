# diesel-rust-learning
Holds the interesting mini projects I have completed while learning rocket and diesel. (omitts many less fruitful tangent projects I went on)

The Diesel folder contains diesel-demo, the code for a database which was a step by step follow of the diesel guide, and diesel-events which contains the code for a database with different variables and versions of CRUD operations

The Rust folder contains a basic rocket program, a static rust webpage (rocket-web) and my current attempts at integrating a database into a webpage (events)
